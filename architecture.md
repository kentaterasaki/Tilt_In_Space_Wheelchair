- Designed to be robust and modular for adjustments.

## 2. Tilt Mechanism
- **Manual lever system** allows users or caregivers to tilt the seat to the desired angle.
- Simple design minimizes moving parts for durability.

## 3. Seating System
- Customizable and ergonomic seat design for comfort and pressure relief.
- Incorporates **cushioning materials** to minimize sores.

## 4. Wheel Assembly
- **Front wheels**: Swivel casters for maneuverability.
- **Rear wheels**: Large-diameter wheels for rough terrain.

## 5. Support and Safety Features
- Includes safety brakes and locking mechanisms for stability.
- Anti-tip bars prevent the chair from tipping over during tilt.
